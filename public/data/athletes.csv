Bree,Walker,aus,bobsled-monobob-women,3,"The world #2 who had a historic season with three World Cup wins, including a dominant gold in St. Moritz. She is arguably the best pure driver in the field, but her medal hopes depend on her push times staying competitive with the power athletes."

Lisa,Buckwitz,ger,bobsled-monobob-women,2,"The 2024 World Champion and overall World Cup winner of the previous two seasons. While she finished 3rd in the standings this year, her explosive push start makes her a threat to lead any race from the first corner."

,Nolte/Levi,ger,bobsled-2-women,5,"The defending Olympic Champions and current World Cup overall winners. They won four of the seven World Cup races this season, including the finale in Altenberg. Their combination of the world's best driving and Levi’s elite push power makes them the gold medal standard."
,Humphries/Jones,usa,bobsled-2-women,3,"The most decorated pilot in history. Since her return, she has been gaining momentum, finishing the season with a silver in the Altenberg finale (Jan 18, 2026) and 2nd in the overall standings. She is a master of peaking for the Olympics, though a small mistake in Cortina's technical bottom section is her only real risk."
,Kalicki/Fiebig,ger,bobsled-2-women,2,"The 2023 World Champions and 3rd in the 2026 overall standings. They are remarkably consistent, finishing on the podium in almost every race this winter. They are ""high variance"" only because they often finish just fractions of a second behind their teammate Nolte."
,Buckwitz/Lipperheide,ger,bobsled-2-women,2,"The 2024 World Champions. They finished the season with a silver in Winterberg and 4th in the overall standings. Buckwitz is arguably the most powerful pusher among the pilots, often giving her team a massive advantage before the first corner."
,Love/Hoffman,usa,bobsled-2-women,2,"A powerhouse duo that secured a silver in Innsbruck this season. Hoffman is an Olympic bronze medalist brakewoman, and Love is the reigning Monobob World Champion. If they nail their timing at the start, they have the speed to win any race."

,Lochner/Fleischhauer,ger,bobsled-2-men,5,"The dominant force of the 2025/2026 season. Lochner won six of the seven World Cup races this winter, including a victory on the Olympic track in Cortina. He is at the absolute peak of his driving powers and is the heavy gold medal favorite."
,Friedrich/Schüller,ger,bobsled-2-men,3,"The ""G.O.A.T."" of bobsled and defending double Olympic Champion. While he finished 2nd in the overall standings, he remains the most technically perfect driver in history. He is ""high variance"" only because Lochner has consistently found more speed this season, but you can never count Friedrich out in a four-run Olympic format."
,Ammour/Hertel,ger,bobsled-2-men,3,"The breakout star who completed the historic German ""clean sweep"" of the season standings. Ammour won the 2024 European title and finished 2nd in the World Cup finale in Altenberg. He represents the future of the sport and is a lock for the podium if he maintains his world-class start times."
,Del Duca/Niederhofer,usa,bobsled-2-men,2,"The top American sled and world #4. Del Duca has been remarkably consistent, finishing in the top six for nearly every race this season.

,Team Germany - Ammour,ger,bobsled-4-men,3,"The breakout star who won the final World Cup race of the season in Altenberg (Jan 18, 2026). Along with his brother Issam Ammour, he has the fastest start times in the world. If he maintains his recent form, an all-German podium sweep is a very real possibility."
,Team Germany - Friedrich,ger,bobsled-4-men,3,"The ""G.O.A.T."" of bobsled. Although he finished 2nd in the overall standings, he won in Winterberg this January and remains the master of the four-run Olympic format. He is ""high variance"" only because he has faced mechanical issues and tighter competition this year than in previous Olympic cycles."
,Team Italy - Baumgartner,ita,bobsled-4-men,1,"The ""Local Hero."" He secured a podium in Innsbruck earlier this season and knows the Cortina track better than anyone. Fuelled by the home fans, his familiarity with the Eugenio Monti curves could propel him into the medals."
,Team GBR - Hall,gbr,bobsled-4-men,2,"The best non-German sled in the world, finishing 4th in the overall standings. Hall is a ""big-game hunter"" who thrives on the world's most difficult tracks. With a fully healthy Taylor Lawrence back in the sled, they are the primary threat to break the German dominance."
,Team Korea - Kim,kor,bobsled-4-men,1,"Made history with Korea’s first-ever 4-man podium in the Cortina season opener. While they’ve been more erratic on European tracks, they clearly love the Olympic venue."
,Team Austria - Treichel,aut,bobsled-4-men,1,A model of consistency who finished the season strong with a 5th place in Altenberg. He is a veteran who rarely makes mistakes and is perfectly positioned to pounce if the favorites falter.
,Team Switzerland - Vogt,sui,bobsled-4-men,1,"Switzerland’s top hope who secured a bronze in St. Moritz just two weeks ago. He is a technical specialist who finds speed in the transitions where other pilots struggle, making him a major podium threat on the Cortina ice."
Ebba,Andersson,swe,crosscountry-skiing-skiathlon-women,4,"The reigning World Champion and 2026 World Cup 10km Freestyle winner.

Frida,Karlsson,swe,crosscountry-skiing-skiathlon-women,2,"A wildcard who can destroy the field on her best day but struggled with positioning in Trondheim (finishing 5th). Her high-risk, high-reward style makes her a gold-or-bust contender."
Teresa,Stadlober,aut,crosscountry-skiing-skiathlon-women,1,The ultimate altitude specialist. She always finds an extra gear in Val di Fiemme and finished a strong 8th in the Trondheim World Cup tune-up.
Astrid,Slind,nor,crosscountry-skiing-skiathlon-women,2,A marathon expert who thrives as the race gets longer and harder. She led much of the Trondheim World Cup race and will likely try to break the pack early in Val di Fiemme.
Jonna,Sundling,swe,crosscountry-skiing-skiathlon-women,3,A sprint legend who can stay with the distance pack if the pace isn't suicidal; she remains the most dangerous person to have in a 100m dash to the line.

In an interval start where she can ""hunt"" the times of others, she is the clear gold medal favorite."
Moa,Ilar,swe,crosscountry-skiing-10km-free-women,2,A revelation in freestyle this year; she finished 2nd in the Trondheim 10km Freestyle (Dec 2025) and has become the most consistent skater on the deep Swedish team.
Ebba,Andersson,swe,crosscountry-skiing-10km-free-women,4,"While she is world-class in both techniques, she is often slightly more vulnerable in pure skating compared to Diggins. However, her high-altitude engine is so massive that she remains a lock for a medal and the biggest threat to Diggins' gold."
Karoline,Simpson-Larsen,nor,crosscountry-skiing-10km-free-women,2,"The breakthrough star of the winter who shocked the field by winning the Alpe Cermis Final Climb and the Davos 10km Freestyle, making her Norway’s premier gold medal threat in the skating interval start."
Astrid,Slind,nor,crosscountry-skiing-10km-free-women,3,"Primarily known for her endurance, she has improved her skating significantly and could use her massive engine to snag a bronze if the conditions are slow and heavy."
Heidi,Weng,nor,crosscountry-skiing-10km-free-women,2,"A specialist on the hilly Val di Fiemme tracks. She excels at skating on steep terrain, which is exactly what the Olympic course offers."
Frida,Karlsson,swe,crosscountry-skiing-10km-free-women,2,"The winner of several freestyle races this season, including a dominant performance in Davos. She is ""high variance"" because she often starts at a pace that is impossible to sustain, leading to dramatic final-kilometer battles."

Ebba,Andersson,swe,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,3,"The gold standard for long-distance classic racing. She is the 2023 World Champion in the 30km Classic and has dominated marathon-style events this season. Her engine is perfectly tuned for the 50km distance, and she rarely has a ""bad"" day in the classic technique."
Moa,Ilar,swe,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,1,"After her massive 10km Freestyle win in Holmenkollen and a top-5 distance ranking this season, she has proven she can hang with the elite; however, she'll need to stay patient during the classic leg to ensure she has enough ""juice"" for the final 10km of a 50km marathon."
Teresa,Stadlober,aut,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,2,"The altitude queen. She has a history of peaking for the longest races of the season and finished on the podium in the Toblach 10km Classic this winter. She will be the ""home"" favorite in the Alps."
Frida,Karlsson,swe,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,3,"The reigning 50km World Champion (from Trondheim 2025). While she won that title in Freestyle, she is a powerhouse in Classic as well.

Heidi,Weng,nor,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,2,A veteran who has found a second wind this season. She finished 2nd in the 50km at the 2025 World Championships and thrives at high altitude. Her tactical intelligence in mass starts makes her a safe bet for the podium.
Astrid,Slind,nor,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,3,"A long-distance specialist who competes in both the World Cup and the Ski Classics marathon circuit.

Jasmi,Joensuu,fin,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,1,"The reigning Sprint World Cup champion is a classic-technique maestro who recently won on the Olympic track in Val di Fiemme, but while her technical ""kick"" is world-class, her endurance over 50km remains a major question mark against the pure distance specialists."
Kerttu,Niskanen,fin,crosscountry-skiing-50km-classic-women,2,"A classic-technique maestro. If the conditions are ""old school"" (icy and technical), she is a top-3 contender. At age 37, the 50km distance is a massive test of her recovery, but her technical efficiency saves her energy."

Caroline,Ulrich,sui,ski-mountaineering-sprint-women,1,"The ""Transition Queen""; while she lacks the raw uphill engine of Emily Harrop, her background as a world-class trail runner and her history of winning major titles on home snow makes her the primary candidate to steal a medal if any of the ""Big Three"" falter."
Ana,Alonso Rodriguez,esp,ski-mountaineering-sprint-women,1,"A veteran superstar who was the overall World #3 before a cycling accident in October 2025.

Alessandro,Hammerle,aut,snowboard-cross-men,2,"The ""Tactician""; he knows exactly how to win an Olympic final, and his lower ranking only makes him a more dangerous ""under-the-radar"" threat."
Aidan,Chollet,fra,snowboard-cross-men,1,"The ""Precision Rider""; he is known for having the most stable board-control in the ""Negative G"" sections of the Livigno course. He currently has more top-5 finishes in 2025/26 than any other Frenchman."

Chloe,Trespeuch,fra,snowboard-cross-women,2,"The 2022 Silver medalist and current World #2. Trespeuch is the anchor of the French ""powerhouse"" squad. She took Bronze in China last week and has been on the podium in almost every race this winter. She is ""high variance"" only because she occasionally gets caught in ""mid-pack"" traffic, but her ability to pass in the final turn is the best in the business."
Josie,Baff,aus,snowboard-cross-women,2,"The ""Yellow Bib""; she is the most consistent rider of 2026 so far, possessing a massive mental edge over the veteran field."
Lea,Casta,fra,snowboard-cross-women,2,"The sensation of the early season. Casta won the opening World Cup in Cervinia (Dec 13) but suffered a high-speed crash in China last week that dropped her in the standings. If she is fully recovered by February 6, her raw ""gate-to-first-turn"" speed makes her a podium lock."
Michela,Moioli,ita,snowboard-cross-women,3,"The ""Livigno Legend""; she is treating these Games as her career finale and will have the most vocal home support of any athlete in Italy."

Eva,Adamczykova,cze,snowboard-cross-women,1,"Formerly Samková. The 2014 Olympic Champion is still one of the most stylish and technically sound riders in the world. While she missed the Big Final in China, she remains a tactical genius who can out-maneuver younger riders in heavy traffic."
Sina,Siegenthaler,sui,snowboard-cross-women,1,"Switzerland’s top hope. She has been a consistent ""Small Final"" winner this year and is currently World #10. She is known for her aggressive starts and could easily sneak into the Big Final."

Zoi,Sadowski-Synott,nzl,snowboarding-slopestyle-women,3,"The ""Triple Threat""; she is the only woman with the ""Triple Cork 1440"" in her arsenal. If she lands it in Livigno, the gold is hers; if she doesn't, Brookes and Murase are ready to pounce."
Mia,Brookes,gbr,snowboarding-slopestyle-women,3,"The ""British Phenom""; her 96.33 at X Games is the highest score recorded in competition this season. She arrives in Milan as the favorite to take Britain's first-ever snowboard gold."
Mari,Fukada,jpn,snowboarding-slopestyle-women,2,
Laurie,Blouin,can,snowboarding-slopestyle-women,2,"Canada’s most consistent veteran. She officially qualified for her third Olympics last week (Jan 16) and finished 7th at the X Games. She has the ""clutch"" gene necessary to steal a medal if the top three falter."
Lily,Dhawornvej,usa,snowboarding-slopestyle-women,2,"The 16-year-old ""Rookie Sensation."" She stunned the field by taking Silver at the Laax Open (Jan 18) in her debut season. While she finished 9th at X Games, her raw talent and fearlessness make her the most dangerous wildcard in the US squad."
Anna,Gasser,aut,snowboarding-slopestyle-women,1,"The legendary two-time Big Air Olympic Champion. At 34, she is on her ""Farewell Tour"" and recently took Bronze at the Laax Open. While Slopestyle is her ""secondary"" event, her air awareness and consistency make her a constant podium threat."

Kokomo,Murase,jpn,snowboarding-bigair-women,3,"The current undisputed queen of Big Air. Two days ago (Jan 24, 2026), she won the X Games Big Air Gold and made history as the first woman to land a Triple Cork 1620 in competition. She is currently the highest-ranked woman in the world and has the most technical run in history."

She is the reigning World Champion and possesses a unique ""flat-spin"" style that judges adore. She is high variance only because she often attempts her most difficult trick (Cab 1440) on her final hit."
Zoi,Sadowski-Synott,nzl,snowboarding-bigair-women,2,"While she focuses more on Slopestyle, she is the only woman who can match Murase's amplitude. She skipped the X Games Big Air final to rest her knee, but if she’s 100% in Milan, she’s a 5-star threat."

She enters the Olympics as the World Cup Leader after winning three consecutive events this winter (Secret Garden, Copper Mountain, and Laax Open). She is the only rider currently pushing Chloe Kim’s technical difficulty, often opening her runs with a switch backside 720 that sets her apart from the Japanese field."
Rise,Kudo,jpn,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,3,"Another 16-year-old prodigy. She took Silver at the X Games last week and Silver at the Laax Open (Jan 17). She is currently World #2 in the standings. She represents the new wave of Japanese riders who treat the 22-foot pipe like a trampoline, specializing in technical ""alley-oop"" tricks."
Elizabeth,Hosking,can,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,2,"Canada’s top hope. She won the Calgary World Cup earlier this season and sits World #3. She is exceptionally strong in icy conditions, which could be a factor in the night-time final in Livigno."
Sena,Tomita,jpn,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,2,
Chloe,Kim,usa,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,2,"The two-time defending Olympic Champion. Kim secured her spot for Milan by winning her third World Title in March 2025 and has been peerless since her return. While she occasionally skips World Cups to manage her health, she is the only woman consistently landing Frontside and Cab 1080s with massive amplitude. She is the ""low variance"" pick because, even with a safe run, she remains 5 points ahead of the field."
Sara,Shimizu,jpn,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,2,"The woman with the most momentum. Just three days ago (Jan 23, 2026), she won X Games Gold in Aspen with a 95.33. She also took Silver at the 2025 World Championships. She is ""high variance"" because she often prioritizes riskier 1080s that lead to falls, but if she stomps her run like she did in Aspen, she is the only person who can realistically take Gold from Kim or Choi."
Queralt,Castellet,esp,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,1,"The Beijing Silver medalist. At 36, she took Bronze at the X Games last week, proving she still has the amplitude to compete with the 16-year-olds."

Cai,Xuotong,chn,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,1,"The veteran legend. At 32, she is heading into her fifth Olympics.

While she lacks the 1080-triple combinations of the teenagers, her ""cleanliness"" always keeps her in the medal hunt."
Mitsuki,Ono,jpn,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,1,"The two-time Crystal Globe winner. She won the Aspen World Cup (Jan 9, 2026) with a flawless 91.00.

Isabelle,Loetscher,sui,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,1,
Madeline,Shaffrick,usa,snowboarding-halfpipe-women,1,"The comeback story of the year. After nearly a decade away from the sport, she took Silver at the Aspen World Cup (Jan 9). She has a high-amplitude, ""old-school"" style that judges are rewarding this season."
Su,Yiming,chn,snowboarding-slopestyle-men,4,"The defending Olympic Big Air champion and Slopestyle silver medalist. Su has been the most consistent rider of the 2025/26 season, taking Silver in Aspen (Jan 10) and Bronze at the Laax Open (Jan 18). He has the highest amplitude in the field, but he is ""high variance"" because he often pushes for a 1980 on the final jump which carries a high crash risk."
Mark,McMorris,can,snowboarding-slopestyle-men,2,"The ""G.O.A.T."" just made a massive statement. Yesterday (Jan 25, 2026), McMorris won X Games Gold with a near-perfect score of 96.33, securing his 25th career X Games medal. Despite being 32, his technical rail precision and ""clutch"" factor on his final run make him the most reliable podium bet in the sport. He is seeking a historic fourth consecutive Olympic slopestyle medal."
Romain,Allemand,fra,snowboarding-slopestyle-men,3,"The breakout star of 2026. On January 18, he made history by becoming the first Frenchman to win a Slopestyle World Cup (Laax Open). His run, featuring a unique backside 1080 pullback to 900, has redefined ""style"" scores this year. He enters Milan with massive momentum."
Yuto,Kimura,jpn,snowboarding-slopestyle-men,3,"The 17-year-old who took Silver at the Laax Open last week. He is the leader of a Japanese squad that specializes in ""flat-spin"" rotations that the judges are heavily rewarding this season."
Jake,Canter,usa,snowboarding-slopestyle-men,2,"The winner of the Aspen World Cup (Jan 10, 2026). After a year of suspension, he has returned with a vengeance. He is currently the highest-ranked American and thrives on high-pressure ""Big Final"" environments."

Red,Gerard,usa,snowboarding-slopestyle-men,1,
Su,Yiming,chn,snowboarding-bigair-men,4,"The defending Olympic Champion and the newly crowned 2025/26 Big Air Crystal Globe winner. Su won back-to-back World Cups in November and December (Chongli and Beijing) with a staggering 181.00 points. He is the most technically consistent rider in the world, combining ""clean"" 1980s with perfect execution scores. He skipped the final World Cup to focus on his ""secret"" Olympic run."
Kira,Kimura,jpn,snowboarding-bigair-men,2,"Currently ranked World #2 overall. He took Bronze at the X Games yesterday and pushed Ogiwara to the limit in Steamboat. He is the most reliable ""podium insurance"" for the Japanese team."
Hiroto,Ogiwara,jpn,snowboarding-bigair-men,2,"The man who just broke the sport. Two days ago (Jan 24, 2026), Ogiwara won X Games Gold by stomping a 2340 (six and a half rotations). He also won the Steamboat World Cup last month. He is ""high variance"" because he regularly crashes on his first two attempts, but if he lands the 2340 in Milan, the gold medal is likely his by a 10-point margin."

Taiga,Hasegawa,jpn,snowboarding-bigair-men,3,

Eli,Bouchard,can,snowboarding-bigair-men,1,"The 18-year-old Canadian superstar.

Valentino,Guseli,aus,snowboarding-halfpipe-men,2,"The most versatile rider in the world. Currently World #2 overall, he won the Calgary World Cup (Jan 3) and has multiple podiums this winter.

Erin,Jackson,usa,speedskating-500m-women,2,"The Defending Olympic Gold Medalist. Jackson officially punched her ticket to Milan on Jan 6, 2026, at the U.S. Trials.

Kim,Min-Sun,kor,speedskating-500m-women,1,"The 2022-23 dominant force. After a sluggish start to the 2025/26 season (finishing 17th in early rounds), she has found her form, taking Bronze at the Hamar World Cup (Dec 15, 2025). She is a ""Big Event"" skater who is peaking at exactly the right time."
Femke,Kok,ned,speedskating-1000m-women,3,"Having her best 1000m season ever. She pushed Leerdam to a photo finish in Salt Lake City (losing by just 0.08s) and took Silver in Hamar last month.

Jutta,Leerdman,ned,speedskating-1000m-women,5,"The ""Gold Standard."" Despite a dramatic fall at the Dutch Olympic Trials on Dec 26, the national committee officially selected her for the team on Jan 1, 2026, citing her total dominance of the World Cup season. She won both the Salt Lake City and Heerenveen 1000m events, posting a world-best time of 1:12.35.

Miho,Takagi,jpn,speedskating-1000m-women,3,"The Defending Olympic Gold Medalist. Takagi proved she is back in peak form by winning the Hamar World Cup (Dec 14, 2025) with a 1:14.39. She is the most technically balanced skater in history, but she is ""high variance"" because she often prioritizes the 1500m and Team Pursuit, which can leave her slightly fatigued for the 1000m sprint."
Brittany,Bowe,usa,speedskating-1000m-women,2,"The veteran and former World Record holder. She finished 4th in Hamar and 5th in Salt Lake City. While she may no longer have the top-end speed of Leerdam, her experience in managing Olympic pressure makes her a 2-star threat."
Suzanne,Schulting,ned,speedskating-1000m-women,2,
Beatrice,Lamarche,can,speedskating-1000m-women,1,"The breakout star of the North American leg. She took a stunning Bronze in Salt Lake City with a 1:12.77 and was officially named to the Canadian Olympic team 11 days ago (Jan 15). She has the ""glide"" and high-speed cornering that matches the elite Dutch skaters."
Rio,Yamada,jpn,speedskating-1000m-women,1,"Japan's second-best 1000m skater. She has three top-6 finishes this winter and is the fastest ""opener"" in the field outside of Femke Kok."

Takagi won the Hamar World Cup (Dec 2025) and pushed Beune to the absolute limit in Inzell, losing by only 0.25s. She is ""high variance"" only because she is skating a massive program in Milan (500m through 3000m + Pursuit); if the schedule is tight, she may lack the explosive power needed for the final 300 meters."
Antoinette,Rijmpa-De Jong,ned,speedskating-1500m-women,4,"The reigning 2025 European Allround Champion. She has been the most consistent ""Silver/Bronze"" threat to Beune and Takagi all season. She holds the fastest time in the world this year (1:51.71 from Salt Lake), but she has occasionally struggled on the ""heavier"" sea-level ice of Europe."
Ragne,Wiklund,nor,speedskating-1500m-women,2,"The endurance machine. Wiklund took Bronze in the Inzell World Cup yesterday and is the reigning World Champion in the 3000m. Her strength is her final lap; if the pace is fast enough to burn out the sprinters (like Kok or Takagi), Wiklund is the favorite to overtake them on the final crossing."
Brittany,Bowe,usa,speedskating-1500m-women,2,"The veteran legend. She finished 5th in Inzell and 6th in the earlier Calgary World Cup. While she lacks the 1:51 speed of the top three, her ""opening"" is still among the fastest in the world. If she gets a favorable pairing, she could sneak onto the podium."

Mei,Han,chn,speedskating-1500m-women,1,"China's top medal hope. She took Bronze at the 2025 World Championships and finished 4th in Inzell last week. She has the most efficient cornering technique in the field and thrives in the high-pressure environment of the ""Big Two"" heats."

Marijke,Groenewoud,ned,speedskating-3000m-women,2,"The 2025 World Champion. She won the Hamar World Cup in December and pushed Beune to the limit at the Dutch Trials. She has the best ""sprint-to-distance"" transition in the world, often winning races in the final 400 meters."
Valerie,Maltais,can,speedskating-3000m-women,2,"The ""Iron Woman"" of Canada. She took Bronze in Inzell yesterday and has been on the podium in three out of five World Cups this winter. At 35, she is skating faster than she did in her 20s and is currently ranked World #3."

Sandrine,Tas,bel,speedskating-3000m-women,1,The surprise European Silver Medalist (Jan 9). She has made massive strides this winter and is the first Belgian woman to seriously contend for a long-track medal.
Martina,Sablikova,cze,speedskating-3000m-women,1,The 38-year-old legend. You can never count out the woman with six Olympic medals. She finished 4th at the European Championships two weeks ago and remains the most tactically sound skater in the pair-draw.
Francesca,Lollobrigida,ita,speedskating-3000m-women,1,"The ""Home Hope."" She took 5th at the European Championships on Jan 9. While she hasn't hit the 3:56 range this year, the ""home ice"" boost in Milan and her tactical experience make her a threat for a surprise bronze."

Isabelle,Weidemann,can,speedskating-5000m-women,3,"The ""Endurance Machine""; she thrives on the ""heavy"" sea-level ice of Milan and is looking to go one better than her Silver in Beijing."
Francesca,Lollobrigida,ita,speedskating-5000m-women,2,"The ""Home Hero."" She set an Italian National Record (6:51.07) in Calgary last year. In Milan, with the crowd behind her for the final laps of the 5000m, she could find the extra energy needed to sneak onto the podium."
Martina,Sablikova,cze,speedskating-5000m-women,1,"The G.O.A.T. of distance skating. At 38, she is still a podium threat, having taken Bronze in the Calgary World Cup earlier this cycle. Her experience in managing the ""Milan ice"" (which can get heavy during long races) is superior to anyone else in the field."
Merel,Conjin,ned,speedskating-5000m-women,3,The reigning Dutch 5000m Champion. She set a massive personal best (6:41.48) in November and is the fastest Dutch skater on the 5k this season. She is a specialist in the 12.5-lap grind and represents the biggest threat to a Wiklund/Weidemann 1-2 finish.

He is currently on a trajectory to attempt an unprecedented triple gold (500m, 1000m, 1500m). He is ""low variance"" because even on a bad day, his technical second lap is so fast that he rarely falls off the podium."
Damian,Zurek,pol,speedskating-500m-men,3,Having a career-best season with several Bronze medals in the World Cup circuit. He is currently Poland's strongest individual medal hope in any skating discipline.
Jenning,De Boo,ned,speedskating-500m-men,2,"The ""Dutch Rocket."" He holds the World Leading Time this season (33.63) set in Salt Lake City. He pushed Stolz to the limit at the Inzell World Cup yesterday, taking Silver. He is ""high variance"" only because he relies on a risky, aggressive start that can occasionally lead to a ""slip"" in the first 100m, but on pure speed, he is the only man who has consistently beaten Stolz's times this winter."
Wataru,Morishige,jpn,speedskating-500m-men,2,"The Beijing Bronze medalist. Morishige won the Japanese National Title (Dec 26, 2025) and has multiple podiums this winter. He is a ""Big Event"" specialist who excels at maintaining speed through the final turn."

While he has struggled to find the ""33-second"" gear this month, his experience and explosive start (9.50s openers) keep him in the medal conversation."
Jordan,Stolz,usa,speedskating-1000m-men,5,"The ""Apex Predator."" Stolz is the reigning three-time World Champion at this distance. Just yesterday in Inzell, he won the 1000m World Cup finale, securing the Overall Crystal Globe. He holds the fastest time in the world this season (1:05.37) and has a technical ""second lap"" that is consistently 0.4 seconds faster than anyone in history. Barring a fall, he is as close to a guaranteed gold as it gets in speed skating."
Damian,Zurek,pol,speedskating-1000m-men,3,Having a career year. He broke the Polish national record twice this winter and is consistently hovering around the 5th–8th place mark.
Jenning,De Boo,ned,speedskating-1000m-men,3,"The ""Dutch Prodigy."" After a breakout 2024 season, de Boo has cemented himself as Stolz’s primary rival. He took Silver in Inzell yesterday and is the only skater this winter to stay within half a second of Stolz at sea level. He is ""high variance"" because he skates a very high-risk line in the final corner, but his raw power makes him the clear favorite for Silver."

Ted-Jan,Bloemen,can,speedskating-5000m-men,1,"The 39-year-old veteran finished 16th yesterday. He’s a ""1"" right now because his form has dipped significantly, but you can never totally count out an Olympic Champion."

Sander,Eitrem,nor,speedskating-10000m-men,2,"The ""World Record Holder."" After his sub-6:00 performance in the 5k yesterday, it is clear he has the best ""engine"" in the world.

Timothy,Loubineaud,fra,speedskating-10000m-men,2,"He took Bronze in the Heerenveen 10k and has been the most consistent ""long-distance"" threat of the year. He has a very ""flat"" pacing profile, meaning he doesn't slow down, which is essential for a 10k podium."
Davide,Ghiotto,ita,speedskating-10000m-men,4,"The ""Titan of the 10k."" While he was 5th in the 5k yesterday, he finished 2nd in the only 10k World Cup this season. He is the reigning World Champion (2025) and has centered his entire life around winning this specific gold on home ice.
